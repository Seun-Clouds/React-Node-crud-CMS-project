ðŸ’» The Project
The CMS is a full-stack application that helps manage clients efficiently. It has:

Frontend: Built with React and styled using TailwindCSS, the interface allows users to view, add, edit, and delete client data dynamically.
Backend: Powered by Node.js and Express, it handles client-related CRUD operations seamlessly.
Database: A PostgreSQL database securely stores client information such as names, emails, job titles, rates, and active/inactive status.

ðŸ”„ Core Features:

Dynamic Filtering and Searching: Users can filter or search through client records in real-time.
Custom Modal for Editing: A modal allows users to update client information or add new clients easily.
Responsive Table: Displays clients with dynamic numbering and status toggles.

ðŸ’¡ Challenges Faced:

Dynamic Row Numbering: Ensuring the table rows reflect consecutive numbering (1, 2, 3) regardless of additions or deletions.
Database Querying: Using SQL to maintain the correct order and structure in the backend.
Frontend-Backend Integration: Smoothly connecting API endpoints to the React frontend for a seamless user experience.

ðŸ™Œ Lessons Learned:

This project reinforced my skills in full-stack development, database management, and problem-solving. It reminded me that building systems from scratch is a crucial foundation for understanding larger, data-intensive pipelines.
